				<h2>
					My Work
				</h2>
				<p>
					The original purpose of this website was to create a page that would demonstrate my ability across the languages I am familar with. I used the other pages on this site to familarize myself with semantic HTML and CSS after going through the internetting is hard tutorial <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/" class="inline-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. This serves as documentation for my personal computing work.

					<h2>
						Java Markdown Conversion
					</h2>
					<p>
						As a final project in an OOP and polymorphism class, I created a rough prototype of a program that walks a filetree from a markdown processor, <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, and converts each markdown file to html. The program creates a webpage for each directory that it visits
						and links to that directory's contents. Once this project is finished it will allow me (or anyone using obsidian notes) to share an obsidian archive with anyone, packaged as a website that is almost universally portable. Using Obsidian notes for school and computing work, I could easily share anything from an entire knowledge base of a certain topic to a portfolio of all of my code snippets and projects in a specific language.

						<a href="flexDemo/flexDemo.html">Flexbox Demo [WIP]</a>
					</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="flexDemo/flexDemo.html" class="inline-link"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is a demostration of several capabilities of the HTML5 flexbox, allowing users to change the attributes of several nested HTML elements. I used this project to help teach myself JavaScript. I used Java to convert HTML code snippets to snippets with escape charachters to include an HTML code block on this page.
