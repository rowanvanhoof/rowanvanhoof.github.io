					Summary
				</h2>
				<p class='subsection-item'>
					At the moment I have no prior job experience, but I have volunteered for several organizations where I interacted with and accomadated for guests and customers. In high school multiple teachers asked classmates to go to me for help, so I am used to helping others who may not be as comfortable with the current task as I am. When given any kind of responsibility, I usually try to find a way to make the process more efficient without sacrificing the quality with which the task is performed.
