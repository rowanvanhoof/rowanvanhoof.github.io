					Summary
				</h2>
				<p class='subsection-item'>
					I worked at Starbucks as a barista and eventually a team trainer from August 2019 to June 2020. At Starbucks I developed team work and communication skills as well as problem resolution with customers. Starbucks has a large focus on "customer connection" as well as "making the moment right" so I have experience in creating postive customer interactions. I spent most of my time on bar before I was a trainer so I understand coffee beverages and the general bar flow. I'm fast on bar without sacrificing beverage quality, which is important to me. In high school multiple teachers asked classmates to go to me for help, so I am used to helping others who may not be as comfortable with the current task as I am. I try to be the best I can at whatever I am doing.
